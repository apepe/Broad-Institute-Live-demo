<div><b>Symptoms of foliar nematodes on chrysanthemum.</b> Foliar nematodes have relatively short life cycles going from egg to adult in approximately 2 weeks. Females can produce large numbers of eggs, so symptoms can occur and spread fairly rapidly. For a literature review, cf. <b>Bik et al. (2009)</b>: Small worms big ideas: evolutionary inferences from nematode DNA. <i>Journal of Biogeography</i>, 37(1):2009. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2699.2009.02219.x<br></div>
